My Submission to an Assessment Exercise for a Junior Developer Role

<b>Important notes: </b>
<ul>
  <li>The author has decided to preserve the state of the ipynb file as is so that the reader may gauge Buraleh's skill set as of early July.</li>
  <li>The assessment exercise was sent to the author at 2020-07-09 14:14 and Buraleh's submitted a response at 2020-07-10 17:39 (proof available on request).</li>
  <li>Buraleh will consider redoing the exercise in the future to serve as a comparison for his skill set progression.</li>
</ul>
